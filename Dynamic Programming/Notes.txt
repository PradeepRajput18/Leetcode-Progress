Dynamic programming is about using the memory ( in the case of recursion ) to use already solved data or problem 


for example in fibonacci series for f(5) = f(n-1)+f(n-2) = f(4)+f(3). so here we already calculated 4th and 3rd positions so we dont again find f(4) instead we use memory to calculate it.
During problem a particular step is solved then again solving it is no use. Thats when we use DP
We need to master recursion to do DP


recursion -> top down 
     flow is (answer)->base case (which returns) ->answer 

Bottom up -> tabulation 
     flow is base case ->answer

it can be done in two ways
    1. Tabulation ( bottom up uproach )
    2. Memorization (top down)
